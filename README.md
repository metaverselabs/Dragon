The open source interface for Dragon Metaverse.

Dragon Metaverse is a shared semi-virtual space built for DRAGON community. It originally started from our first collective metaverse estate - Dragon City (Genesis), Decentraland - a community district consisting of 6,485 parcels of LAND contributed by hundreds of members worldwide in 2017. Dragon Metaverse, independent of the new buzzword "Metaverse", is expected to become a chain of cities that integrates finance, culture, technology, and future lifestyle.
